# Render Runtime

The Render Framework runtime that runs on server and client.

Render apps should depend on both `render-builder` (to be bundled) and `render-runtime` (to be executed).

### Getting Started

First, install the VTEX Toolbelt and login:

```bash
$ npm i -g vtex@next
$ vtex login
```

Then, use `link` to start developing your app:

```bash
$ vtex link
```
